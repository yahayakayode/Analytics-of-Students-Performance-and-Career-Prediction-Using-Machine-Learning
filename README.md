### Analytics of Students Performance and Prediction Using Machine Learning Teachniques

### Background 
> In today's world, one of the most crucial choices a students must make is selecting a suitable career choice while in school.  
Undoubtedly, most students often face the problem of choosing the right career path without proper guidance from qualified professional services. They usually mismatch their career path regarding their personality, skills, and interest. In most cases, students are even forced to opt for a career path such as medicine, accounting, or engineering as a result of pressure from family, friends, and perhaps the greed for high pay.

### Project Overview
> This project focuses on investigating the factors that influence students academic performance, and to also build and train machine learning model to make career choice prediction and recommendation for students based on their academic performance.
